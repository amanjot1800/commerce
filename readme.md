# Auctions website

### Django and Python project

This website allows users to post a listing and allow other users to place a bid on it. 
The OP has the option to close the auction at any time, thus making the highest bidder 
the winner of the auction. 

Users have the ability to: 
* add images
* select categories
* add comments
* add the listings to their personal watchlist

Only the users who are registered and logged in can bid, create new listings, add comments and add items to
their watchlist.
